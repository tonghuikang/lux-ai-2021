# [Lux AI] Working Title Bot
The code structure and logic, and version updates are elaborated in the comment section.

I hope this can be a useful template for you to work on your bot on.
You are recommended to edit on a clone/fork of [my repository](https://github.com/tonghuikang/lux-ai-2021) with your favorite IDE.
You can submit the zip the repository to the competition. This notebook is generated with `generate_notebook.py`.

Regardless, do feel free to clone this notebook and submit `submission.tar.gz` under the "Data" tab.

# Game Rendering
This is a replay of the agent fighting against itself.

The missions of each unit is annotated.
`X` and `O` indicates target position for the unit to move to.
In addition, `O` indicates that the unit will build a citytile upon arrival at the tile.

`O` on the city tile indicates that the citytile have enough fuel to last to the end of the game.
Otherwise, the number of nights it can endure will be indicated on the tile.

The inscription on the unit indicates the amount of total resources it has, and the majority type of resource.
`F` indicates that it has at least 100 resources. If the unit has moved in the turn, the inscription is annotated on the previous location.

In the run, we have saved the game state and missions as Python pickle files.

For visualisation, we plot `convolved_collectable_tiles_matrix`.

You could also print other attributes of `game_state`.
